<h2>Checking inputs</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Imagine that you want to buy a present for your friend, but you have little money. You want to choose a present which costs more than 120 cents and less than 137 cents.</p>
<p>Implement a function called <code class="java">check()</code> that takes a number as an argument. The function checks whether the number lies between <code class="java">120</code> and <code class="java">137</code>. If the input is as expected, print it. If it is border or invalid, print the message <code class="java">"That's a bad present!"</code></p>
<p>You do not need to take any input or call the function yourself. Only integer numbers will be given as parameters to the function.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
