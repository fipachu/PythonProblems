<h2>Sphere</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p><p>In her projects, Jess works with various geometrical objects. To simplify the process, she needs to create different classes for the shapes.</p><p>One of these shapes is a <strong>sphere</strong>. There are 3 characteristics she needs for the sphere: the <em>PI </em>number, the <em>radius </em><strong><em>r </em></strong>and the <em>volume </em><strong><em>v </em></strong>of the particular sphere.</p><p>The volume is calculated according to this formula: <strong><span class="math-tex">\(v = \frac {4}{3} \pi r^3\)</span></strong>. </p><p>Finish writing the code below: determine which attributes are class or instance attributes, and do necessary calculations. Make sure to name the attributes like they are presented above (that is, <code class="java">PI</code>, <code class="java">radius</code>, and <code class="java">volume</code>.) Use <span class="math-tex">\(\pi \approx  3.1415\)</span> (for checkup purposes).</p><p>You do NOT need to create any instances of the class or work with input.</p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>The constant can be stored as a class variable, the <em>radius </em>can be passed as a parameter to the <code class="java">__init__</code> method, and <em>volume</em> can be calculated within the <code class="java">__init__</code>.</p></div><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
